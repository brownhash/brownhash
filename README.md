# Hi there 👋

My name is Harshit. I live in Mumbai 🇮🇳 and my timezone is UTC+05:30.

> I'm currently working on - **MLOps 🤖**

### The open source projects that I'm currently focusing on are

- [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform)
- [Cli](https://github.com/mitchellh/cli)
- [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
- [Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt)
- [Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)

All the above projects display my interest in Golang & Python and the kind of work I do. 
These help me to understand the latest developments & standards going on. 

### Open to discuss about

- High scale application architectures
- Managing your infrastructure with style
- Infrastructure as Code in general
- Scripting with Go & Python

Ps: I ❤️ dogs. Currently in love with a Pitbull.
